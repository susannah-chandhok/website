# Background
This is a homework assignment I completed for a graduate course in [Data Science and Predictive Analysis](http://www.socr.umich.edu/people/dinov/2018/Fall/DSPA_HS650/) at the University of Michigan in Fall 2018.

**Problem 4.1**

Construct an R protocol to examine the job-stress level (**Stress_Level**) and hiring-potential (**Hiring_Potential**) using the job description (JD) (**Description**) text.

# Set-Up Workspace

## Dataset Description
- The data we are using for homework 4 is the [SOCR Dataset Ranking the Best and Worst USA Jobs for 2011](http://wiki.socr.umich.edu/index.php/SOCR_Data_2011_US_JobsRanking#2011_Ranking_of_the_200_most_common_Jobs_in_the_US).
- The variables in this data are
    - **Index**: Ranks of the 200 most common jobs based on the Overall_Score variable (lower rank/index indicates better job, and higher rank indicates a less desirable job for 2011). Overall Rank Index represents the sum of the rankings in each of the five variable (below) where each of the variables are assumed (but this may not necessarily be true) to be equally important.
    - **Job Title**: title of the profession
    - **Overall_Score**: A *Dependent variable* corresponding to the linearly predicted overall rank of this job using the remaining explanatory variables (below).
    - **Average_Income** (USD): An estimate of the mid-levels income for this profession.
    - **Work_Environment**: Work environment for each job reflects 2 basic factors: physical and emotional components. Points are assigned for potential for adverse working conditions (larger scores). In other words, fewer work-environment points would yield a lower (better) job rank and higher points reflect lower quality environments.
    - **Stress_Level**: Expected level of job-related stress dependent on 11 potential stress factors. A high stress score implies that stress is a major part of the job, and lower stress score indicates lower job-relates stress.
    - **Stress_Category**: Categorical data where lower number seems to correspond to less stress while higher number is higher stress
    - **Physical_Demand**: The total physical demand if a job. Higher number means more physically demanding.
    - **Hiring_Potential**: The hiring-potential rank assigns higher scores to jobs with promising future outlook and lower scores for less future potential.
    - **Description**: A brief job description for each profession.

- We have 200 observations (200 jobs) and 10 variables (information about the jobs).

```r
str(job_data)
```

```
## 'data.frame':	200 obs. of  10 variables:
##  $ Index              : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...

```

## Prepare the data

- Remove Index variable, which contains the rank-ordering of the jobs

```r
job_data$Index <- NULL
```

- Turn Stress_Category into a factor

```r
# turn Stress_Category into a factor
job_data$Stress_Category <- factor(job_data$Stress_Category)
```

- Remove some of the unneccessary *punction,* *contractions,* and *conjunctions* from the job description variable using `gsub`

```r
# remove the underscores in the job descriptions using the gsub() function
job_data$Description <- gsub("_", " ", job_data$Description)

# remove the apostrophes and contractions
job_data$Description <- gsub("'", "", job_data$Description)

# remove all the "and", "the", and "for" because they aren't super relevant
job_data$Description <- gsub(" and ", " ", job_data$Description)
job_data$Description <- gsub(" the ", " ", job_data$Description)
job_data$Description <- gsub(" for ", " ", job_data$Description)
job_data$Description <- gsub(" from ", " ", job_data$Description)
job_data$Description <- gsub(" with ", " ", job_data$Description)
```


# Process text data for analysis
- Install `tm` package

```r
# install.packages("tm", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
# requires R V.3.3.1 +
library(tm)
```

- First step for text mining is to convert text features (text elements) into a corpus object, which is a collection of text documents.
- From homework: *Convert the textual JD meta-data into a corpus object.*

```r
job_data_corpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(job_data$Description))  
## VectorSource() interprets each element of the vector x as a document
## A Corpus is unique because Corpus objects store text alongside metadata, like author, datetimestamp, id, language, etc.

print(job_data_corpus)
```

```
## <<SimpleCorpus>>
## Metadata:  corpus specific: 1, document level (indexed): 0
## Content:  documents: 200
```

- Each document represents a single description for a job. We have 200 jobs in our dataset, thus 200 documents corresponding to 200 job descriptions.

```r
inspect(job_data_corpus[1:3])
```

```
## <<SimpleCorpus>>
## Metadata:  corpus specific: 1, document level (indexed): 0
## Content:  documents: 3
##
## [1] Researches designs develops maintains software systems along hardware development medical scientific industrial purposes
## [2] Applies mathematical theories formulas to teach or solve problems in a business educational or industrial climate       
## [3] Interprets statistics to determine probabilities of accidents sickness death loss of property theft natural disasters
```

- Use `tm_map()` function for cleaning the corpus document.
- From homework: *Triage some of the irrelevant punctuation and other symbols in the corpus document, change all text to lower case, etc.*

```r
corpus_clean <- tm_map(job_data_corpus, tolower)  ## changed all the characters to lower case

corpus_clean <- tm_map(corpus_clean, removePunctuation) ## removed all punctuations

corpus_clean <- tm_map(corpus_clean, removeNumbers) ## remove all numbers

corpus_clean <- tm_map(corpus_clean, stripWhitespace) ## remove all extra white spaces  (typically created by deleting punctuations)
```

- Inspect the corpus to make sure everything looks alright

```r
inspect(corpus_clean[21:27])
```

```
## <<SimpleCorpus>>
## Metadata:  corpus specific: 1, document level (indexed): 0
## Content:  documents: 7
##
## [1] assesses hearing speech language disabilities provides treatment assists individuals communication disorders through diagnostic techniques

## [3] loan officers help people apply loans this lets people do things like buy a house or a car or pay college                                 
## [4] plans drilling locations effective production methods optimal access to oil natural gas                                                   
## [5] assesses patients dietary needs plans menus instructs patients their families about proper nutritional care                               
## [6] transforms scientific technical information into readily understandable language                                                          
## [7] diagnoses visual disorders prescribes administers corrective rehabilitative treatments
```

- `DocumentTermMatrix()` function can successfully tokenize the job description into words. It can count frequent terms in each document in the corpus object.
- From homework: *Tokenize the job descriptions into words.*

```r
job_data_dtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(corpus_clean)
```

- Inspect to make sure DocumentTermMatrix looks correct

```r
head(job_data_dtm$dimnames$Terms)
```

```
## [1] "along"       "designs"     "development" "develops"    "hardware"   
## [6] "industrial"
```

```r
tail(job_data_dtm$dimnames$Terms)
```

```
## [1] "framework" "raises"    "steel"     "pipelines" "rigs"      "shore"
```

```r
inspect(job_data_dtm[,1:5])
```

```

# Binarize Job Stress
## Binarize the Job Stress for training
- Binarize the Job Stress into two categories (low/high stress levels)
- `a %in% b` is an intuitive interface to match and acts as a binary operator returning a logical vector (T or F) indicating if there is a match between the left and right operands.

```r
plot(job_data_train$Stress_Category)
```

# Word count into categorical data
- we are going to make frequencies of words into features.
- we will create indicators for words that appear at least in 3 different documents in the training data.

```r
summary(findFreqTerms(job_data_dtm_train, 2))
```

```

- The Naive Bayes classifier trains on data with categorical features, as it uses frequency tables for learning the data affinities. To create the combinations of class and feature values comprising the frequency-table (matrix), all feature must be categorical.

```r
convert_counts <- function(wordFreq) {
  wordFreq <- ifelse(wordFreq > 0, 1, 0)
  wordFreq <- factor(wordFreq, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("No", "Yes"))
  return(wordFreq)
}
```


```r
job_train <- apply(job_train, MARGIN = 2, convert_counts)
job_test <- apply(job_test, MARGIN = 2, convert_counts)

# Check the structure of the data
dim(job_train)
```

```
## [1] 180 142
```

```r

## Multivariate Linear Model
- To predict Overall job ranking (smaller is better). Generate some informative pairs plots. Use backward step-wise feature selection to simplify the model, report the AIC.

```r
colnames(job_data)
```

```
## [1] "Job_Title"           "Overall_Score"       "Average_Income(USD)"
## [4] "Work_Environment"    "Stress_Level"        "Stress_Category"    
## [7] "Physical_Demand"     "Hiring_Potential"    "Description"
```

```r
